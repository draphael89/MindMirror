# MindMirror: AI-Powered Personal Writing Amplification System

## 1. Project Overview

MindMirror is an innovative platform designed to capture, analyze, and amplify a user's personal writing style through the power of AI. The system takes daily voice notes as input, processes them to understand the user's unique style and ideas, and generates high-quality, authentic essays that reflect the user's voice and thought processes.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Voice Note Capture and Transcription
- Utilize a mobile application for recording daily voice notes (e.g., Superhuman)
- Implement OpenAI's Whisper model (or similar) for accurate voice-to-text transcription
- Store transcribed notes in a database for further processing

### 2.2 Personal Style Analysis
- Develop an AI model to analyze accumulated voice notes
- Extract key features of the user's writing style, including vocabulary, sentence structure, and thematic preferences
- Continuously update the style profile as new voice notes are added

### 2.3 Essay Architecture Generation
- Create an AI "architect" model to extract main ideas from individual voice notes
- Generate a structured outline for each essay, including key points and logical flow

### 2.4 Content Generation
- Develop an AI model that combines the essay structure with the user's personal style
- Generate full essay content that authentically represents the user's voice and ideas
- Implement a feedback loop to improve generation quality over time

### 2.5 Web Application
- Create a user-friendly interface for viewing and managing generated content
- Implement features for tagging, categorization, and search functionality

## 3. Technical Stack

### 3.1 Frontend
- React with Vite for fast development and optimal performance
- TypeScript for improved code quality and developer experience
- Tailwind CSS for responsive and customizable styling
- Consider Astro for enhanced interactivity and animations

### 3.2 Backend
- Node.js with Express for API development
- MongoDB for flexible data storage of voice notes and generated content

### 3.3 AI/ML
- Integrate with Anthropic's Claude API (specifically Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for advanced language processing tasks
- Utilize transfer learning techniques to fine-tune models on the user's personal data
